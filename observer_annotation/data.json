Overall, the number of officers (all ranks) had also increased from 13.12% in 1970 to 16.19% in 2020 (and 18.22% in 2023). Even former SecDef Robert Gates in 2010 noted that while the overall force structure was cut by 40% in the 1990s, the reduction in GOFO was about half of that. That results in multiple layers of command that have to process and provide input on decisions.\n\nReducing GOFOs isn't automatically a bad idea, even if it's coming from the current SecDef, but it will be informative to see which GOFOs are removed from their positions and whether those positions are eliminated or filled with a more \"acceptable\" candidate (to the Administration).",

      "Joan of Arc, and in general these young saint girls from the middle ages who claimed they talked to god. But Joan especially. Her story is beyond belief and we know so much because much of the documentation remained.     \n\nThis fucking 17 year old peasant girl went to see Charles VII, dauphin of France, to tell him that God sent her and that alone seems like a big deal but isn't (plenty of girls claimed to be inspired by God then); the big deal is she told him God sent her not to bless him, but to lead his army to break the siege of Orleans and then drive him to be crowned King of France.      \n\nThis is not fiction or exaggeration, is precisely what happened (and through no small risk or pain for herself, cause when at home she insisted with her parents that she needed to go join the army, her father assumed she would end up a camp prostitute, and to avoid the shame, he considered drowning her).       \n\nNow imagine a 17 year old girl today going to Volodymir Zelensky and telling him \"hey buddy, God says you need to make me commander in chief of your troops; I'll take care of the rest\". That's what happened.        \n\nExcept it was 1429 and back then this shit was taken seriously. Charles VII was no idiot, he thought: \"maybe this girl is just nuts\". Here's the issue though, that would never cross our mind today, but it absolutely did in 1429: \"What if she's not nuts?\"        \n\nSo what do we do? We test her. So Charles sends her to be examined by priests and general wise men. Who conclude three things: 1. Joan is not crazy. 2. Joan is a good catholic and 3. Joan is virgin (and that's a big deal)        \n\n\"Fuck it\", says Charles, he gives armor, a weapon, a horse, a banner. And an army. It's still unclear how this 17 year old girl who barely ate was going around in platemail, but she was. And the bitch rides to Orleans, breaks the siege as promised, but not before sending to the english the most fucking badass letter of warning ever which I encourage you to read but says (and I paraphrase, but not by much): \"King of England, pull back your troops and leave, because I am a war leader and I am sent by God; and as long as your troops leave I will show mercy, but if they do not I will wipe the fuck out of them wherever I see them\".        \n\nAnd all of this is the LEAST known part of her story since her trial by the Inquisition is the most well known. Trial in which they have a hard time accusing her of anything because despite an inquisition tribunal entirely bent on burning her at stake (on orders from the english and with the tacit approval of the french who betrayed her), for whatever reason this peasant girl who we cannot tell for sure if she can even read is able to avoid all the rhetorical traps in which they try to lure her. She handles herself so well in looking like a good catholic that the only way they manage to condemn her is because she dresses like a man (immoral and heretic, for the time).       \n\nEven so, the way the inquisition work is not that they just condemn you and burn you; you always have the possibility to admit your guilt, recant and be freed (as long as you don't commit the same sin you recanted, in that case you go straight in the fire).         \n\nJoan is shown the pyre as a threat, and she decides to recant. She asks and receives forgiveness and should be freed, as long as she stops wearing men's clothes.       \n\nSo what happens? We don't know. She is found dressed like a man in her cell again. A theory is she is threatened by the guards of rape and she feels safer dressed like that; she should be, after all, prisoner of the church and guarded by priests but she is (against inquisition rules) in military custody. Maybe they just left her men's clothes and she naively wore them. Whatever the case, they get her and she burns. It's said that in later years, as her legend endured and grew, her executioner went desperate that he'd go to hell for having killed a holy woman.",

      "Why is voter ID such a controversial topic?\n\nNever really was able to get my head around this. It seems like a good idea, since I feel that voting is a right of adult American citizens who participate in the social contract. To me the idea that each American citizen should have to verify their identity when voting in order to combat election fraud just seems like common sense.\n\nI also feel like having your ID when you go to vote is a low bar to clear, especially considering that many people drive to their polling places and therefore not only own an ID but (legally must) have it on them anyway, even if it\u2019s not required to vote. I take my wallet (containing my driver\u2019s license) everywhere, even if I\u2019m not driving.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t have a license for one reason or another, I feel that that doesn\u2019t justify not having the ability to identify yourself to vote. If you\u2019re a citizen, you almost certainly have a social security card. If you don\u2019t, you can apply for one.\n\nIt\u2019s not like voter ID laws wouldn\u2019t ask you to identify yourself every time you leave your house. You\u2019re voting for the president of the united states.\n\nTo me it seems very simple to the point where I\u2019m inclined to believe I don\u2019t understand the entire situation.

I own a business that relies on Chinese Manufacturing to get machines that I work with as well as screws for a product I make. American made screws just don\u2019t work for me because I\u2019m too small to make it worth it for both parties. I can\u2019t buy a turning machine to make my own screws because it\u2019s too expensive and would be wasteful. I design, mill every other part I need, assemble, and ship myself. \nSecond and subjectively, I don\u2019t support what I\u2019ve seen of China\u2019s morals. There\u2019s too much waste/junk that they flood the world with and they don\u2019t respect IP laws. Personally, I don\u2019t even know if the factory that makes the screws treats their workers with a basic level of human decency. What I do know is plenty of businessmen have no problem stealing my product to sell it for a tenth of the cost with little to no respect to request to remove. They don\u2019t even make it correctly, thus hurting my reputation in the eyes of people who don\u2019t know better. \nI also want to expand on the junk part of my issue. Americans import junk. The products are wasteful and disposable in the worst ways. Can we support the future of that waste realistically? I feel like their side is transfer and bleed as much wealth out of the rest of the world and because Americans largely get what they want for dirt cheap, we don\u2019t consider any part of the machine they\u2019ve created or whether it does good for the world as a whole. \nChina has made everyone in the world reliant on them. Cool! But can it be good and fair to everyone with respect to a better future? Does America specifically have any room to actually take on *some* of the manufacturing capabilities that would need replacing? We talk a lot about wages and say No! We can\u2019t compete! But we also pay c-suite people outrageous salaries. As someone who has done the whole entire process of bringing a new valid and needed product to market, I would just like to see more of that here in America as it\u2019s not as unattainable as people would think.

We saw people muttering about how rude it was as they walked past her. \n\nMy mom made a beeline for her and saying loudly as she went \u201cwhat a brilliant idea, you are such a good mom.\u201c And proceeded to go on and on quite loudly About how her son must really enjoy the day, being able to walk at his own pace, and not to have his arm up in the air holding onto Mom, and how with a crowd of people it was nice to know that the kid couldn\u2019t suddenly dart away. And that they both must be able to enjoy their time at the fair. And that the leash was such a brilliant idea. I think my mom must\u2019ve gone on and on for five minutes, loudly praising the brilliance of this leash.\n\nShe ended by saying something like \u201cif you hear someone say it\u2019s inhumane or something, you ignore them. I wish I\u2019d been smart enough to have a leash on my toddlers when they were little. You just remember that you are giving your son a more enjoyable day, and you and your husband are able to relax and enjoy it as well because you do not have to worry whether he is Going somewhere.\u201d\n\nFrankly, when I was six or so, I could\u2019ve used the leash when visiting the city, because our family lore has three stories of times I accidentally wandered away or turned the wrong direction or didn\u2019t turn when the family turned, and my parents had to go figure out where I was",

Highly active. We could be sitting in the backyard, coloring with chalk, and in two seconds flat he was across the garden at the fence. I wouldn't even have time to stand up, and he's gone. Thankfully, I have fully fenced yard, so he wasn't getting out, but he was quick. I think he plays soccer now. Anyway, we would go out to parks and museums during the day, and he HAD to be leashed. Holding him was impossible. He was wiggly and strong in the way only very adamant three years can be. One time, while at a sculpture  with HIS MOM, he wriggled from his leash and tried to DIVE into a shallow waterlily pond. Fortunately, my kid was in the stroller asleep, and I was closer to him, so I could catch him, but it wouldn't have been good. Another time, while walking from my front door to his dad's car (12 feet tops), he bolted and tried to run into the street while a car was coming. I managed to snag him with the strap of his backpack that I was holding, but again, it could have been bad. I no longer think leashes for children are insane. Sometimes, a kids only goal in life to try to end it as quickly as possible, and if there's a tool that helps to stop that, more power to it.",
      "My dad got me a kid leash. It wasn\u2019t even a backpack one, he just got me a nylon dog harness at the feed store. \n\nHe got a fair bit of judgement, but all I remember of it was that he let me pick out my color (purple, so I matched our Great Dane who also had purple harnesses and leashes) and that I thought it was cool that he let me hang keychains off the rings. \n\nBut he was glad it was on me the time we went to a flea market and he felt it get tugged\u2026 I was wearing a jacket over it and some dude picked me up and tried to walk away, just to realize I was on a eight foot tether to my very angry father. Apparently a few people from nearby booths came to help beat the shit out of the would-be kidnapper until cops arrived. \n\nI don\u2019t remember this at all, except for a hazy memory of a Hispanic lady holding me in her lap and telling me to look at the chickens she was selling and asking if I\u2019d like to pet them, which I very much wanted to do, lol. \n\nI told my dad about that memory when I was a teenager and he told me \u201cOh that was Lucia, she was trying to make sure you weren\u2019t scared while we waited for the cops.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized the memory was from that day until then, I think I just assumed Dad was haggling over livestock and she was seizing the chance for a cuddle.

There's also often a bra which feels pointless because (most) men don't need one. It feels like a man's idea of what women think is sexy.\n\nWomen's lingerie is just sexy. It draws attention to and teases their sexy bits. There's nothing gimmicky, it's just an appeal to the male gaze.\n\nIs there something men can wear for the same effect? Something that says \"I'm trying to seduce you\" without any gimmick or irony? Something that is just a pure appeal to the female gaze? If such a thing exists.",

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nHere is my weekly US question. All the films and culture I\u2019ve seen in America they use this semi transparent orange bottles with your name on a tag along with the name of the prescription. \n\nHere comes the tricky part. I always though that you got a new bottle every time you went to the pharmacy for your medication, but apparently they refill them pill by pill! For me it is curious af because in every country I\u2019ve been here in Europe I\u2019ve used boxes that has blisters with the pills, and you get a new one every time you have it prescribed. \n\nSo why is this? Why do you refill your bottles instead of getting new ones? Doesn\u2019t it have a risk of getting one or two more or less than normal? Is it true they are orange with your name on a tag?\n\nThanks in advance.",
    "comments": [
      "Yes. In my experience they are not refilled. I get a new bottle with a refill. \"Refill\" isn't used in a literal way about the bottle.",
      "Yes, it's true most pharmacies in the U.S. dispense prescription pills in amber plastic bottles with child-resistant caps. The color helps protect medications from light. Pharmacies count the pills for each refill and print a personalized label with the patient\u2019s name, drug info, dosage, and instructions. It's done this way because medications in the U.S. often come in bulk to pharmacies, rather than in manufacturer blister packs like in Europe.",
      "\"refill\" refers to how many times you can get more pills before you need a new prescription.   A prescription for 120 days you may get 1 bottle with 3 refills before the DR has to write a new prescription.  Each \"refill\" is a new bottle or box",
      "There are some that come in blister packs. I have some right now that do. The bottles have been more common, though, in my experience.\n\nI've always gotten a new bottle.\n\nOrange is common, but ive also had brown and opaque white.",
      "What about storage guys? Do you all keep it inside of the mirror at the top of the sink in the bathroom?",
      "Often true, I'd call them translucent brown rather than orange. \n\nSometimes one gets a manufacturers box/packaging, not usually.\n\nTag is your name, drug name, drug strength (like 10 mg), drug quantity (like #30-30 pills) drug date filled, prescriber name, short instruction (like take twice a day with water),  prescription number.\n\nOne pharmacy near me only fills Rxs in blister packs now.",
      "Absolutely! I get a new bottle every time.",
      "Yes it's the orange bottles. But it's a new bottle for each refill (and a different one for each medication). They come with a label that has your name, your doctor's name, the medication, the instructions for taking it, the date it was filled, the date it expires, any warnings (e.g. causes drowsiness, don't take after eating).\n\nI don't know why we do it this way instead of the blister packs. Though the blister packs seem pretty inflexible -- what if the doctor wants you to take a dose that doesn't align with the blister packs, or if you're a preteen and need a smaller dose? I guess the bottles (they're filled by pharmacy technicians and checked by pharmacists) do introduce a risk of error, but I think that happens very rarely.\n\nAnd some medications do come in blister packs. I don't know why. But a migraine medication I used to take came in blisters, and I've usually seen azithromycin (a somewhat common antibiotic) in them too.",
      "A word about childproof caps:  \n\nYes, the law says medicine is dispensed in bottles with childproof caps, and this is a good law and has saved lives.  But you can get your prescriptions in bottles without them if you ask.   You will have to sign a waiver every time, but if you don\u2019t have young children in your home it\u2019s worth it for the convenience.  \n\nInterestingly, veterinarians dispense medication in bottles with apps that are childproof if put on one way, and not childproof if put on upside down.   And some mail order pharmacies use this type as well.",
      "Yes. My veterinarian uses blue or green bottles for easy identification. \n\nMy partner is on multiple daily medications and ends up with a lot of bottles. A local pet-related charity asks for donations of empty pill bottles so they can reuse them for their clients, so every few months I go and drop off a bag of pill bottles."

For example Japanese Americans born in the USA and adopted by white families could own property so sometimes a white family friend would legally adopt a kid so he could own the family farm).\n\n\nIn the Northwest, many Japanese Americans were farmers. Unless a neighbor was able to tend to their animals, crops, and land, they would return home to find the farms they'd worked hard to build up overgrown and desolate, the animals dead or gone, the fields overgrown, etc.",
      "I'm reading a book right now called Infamy by Richard Reeves. He interviewed a lot of people for it. Japanese families had short notice to sell their belongings. White people would offer  like $250 for an entire store worth $25,000. Some people would go lie to a family that they had one day to pack, then their friends would swing by a couple hours later to buy things on the cheap. The state of California was also legally able to seize \"abandoned\" property.\n\nThere were a couple stories about people who managed their neighbors' farms and held portions of the profit for them upon return. But that was rare.\n\nThere were two women mentioned who had random white men come up to them while they were trying to pack and deal with their houses. The men would be like \"I'll give you $10 for your china set worth $250.\" These two women took every plate out of its velvet bag and smashed them on the ground rather than take that insult.\n\nI'm only ~100 pages in but people also had to buy things in the camp. If you wanted clothes, books, good bedding, you had to mail order it or have someone on the outside who could help do it for you. So not only did these people lose generations worth of property and wealth, and have their bank accounts frozen in many cases, they also still had to have money inside the camps.",

The owner at the time allowed people to store their stuff there with the idea they'd come back for their things, but obviously many never did. \n\nFinally, down the block from the Panama are several buildings that were owned by internees and sold quickly and clearly during the internment process. In at least one case a Jewish family bought a building with the started intent of holding it for the internees until they returned, and so that building is still owned by a Japanese family but the rest aren't. \n\nSeattle s Nihonnmachi used to spread all the way to where Harborview Hospital is today...at least a mile...but now it's just a few blocks.

The list could change in that time. Separately, the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm that handles trade matters, is expected to share a paper with the US this week to try to kickstart the negotiations, Bloomberg reported earlier.\n\nProposals from the EU are expected to include lowering trade and non-tariff barriers and boosting investments in the US.\n\nNegotiations between the EU and US, which began in earnest last month, have made scant progress and the expectation is that the bulk of the American tariffs will remain in place. The EU said on Tuesday that Trump's ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc's goods facing tariffs to \u20ac549 billion.\n\nA commission spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the \u20ac21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump\u2019s 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered his so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.\n\nTrump has also imposed a 25% duty on cars as well as some car parts and has initiated investigations that could result in duties on the imports of lumber, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, critical minerals and trucks.\n\nThe commission has said all options are on the table in response to Trump\u2019s levies and future measures could target services and restrict exports, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nSource (bloomberg, no paywall link): [https://archive.ph/SjPCO](https://archive.ph/SjPCO)",

    "body": "So, my son (18) is graduating highschool in a few weeks and has landed himself a great job starting the week after he's done with school. He will be making $23/hr (in our area, that's pretty stupidly great money, especially for an 18 yr old kid). He is coming to live with me for a while so he can save some money and get himself on a good path in life while he decides what he wants to do (school, military, career, etc). \nI will be charging him rent but aside from putting a little extra into the household expenses, I'm planning to put most of it back for him as a \"you did good, here's a gift to get you going\" thing when he moves out as I'm doing reasonably well myself and don't really need the extra. \nNow, having said all that, I'm wanting to know what I can have HIM invest in while he's working to set himself up as well as he can. I'm already helping him separately save up an emergency fund ($1500) and money for some other expenses we know he will have, but aside from that, I want him to put some money into some long term stuff that will set him up as well as is possible while he's got this opportunity. \nSo are there some good general funds, mutual funds, I know target date funds tend to under-perform so we're staying away from those, but like, what can I have him sink a few hundred dollars a month into without it going to waste?\nThanks in advance.

The shale revolution has evolved from proof of concept (outspend cash flow to prove up basins) to manufacturing mode (significant growth) and is now in a more mature stage of development (free cash flow generation and return of capital). Today, geologic headwinds outweigh the tailwinds provided by improvements in technology and operational efficiency. On an inflation-adjusted basis, there have only been two quarters since 2004 where front month oil prices have been as cheap as they are today (excluding 2020 which was impacted by the global pandemic). Therefore, we believe we are at a tipping point for U.S. oil production at current commodity prices.\n\nAs crude pricing moves lower for a period of time, as it has over the last month, we expect activity to slow and oil production to decline. We currently estimate that the U.S. frac crew count is already down ~15% this year, with the Permian Basin crew count down ~20% from its January peak, and both are expected to decline further. We also expect the U.S. oil directed rig count to be down almost 10% by the end of the second quarter and decline further in the third quarter. As a result of these activity cuts, it is likely that U.S. onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter.\"",

The two men will want to \u201chelp Trump to destroy American supremacy and arrive at a multipolar world order where Russia and China can thrive.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-heads-russia-mission-weaken-120012489.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-heads-russia-mission-weaken-120012489.html)",

      "USA is perfectly capable of weakening itself without any foreign help.",
      "Great.",
      "He'd be doing that whether there was a trade war or not. They are autocrats with no chance of being voted out. Once Trump has completely banned the congress (he'll try), then Xi, Putin, and Trump will be best of friends. They already are, but have to keep it sort of under the table (at least with Xi).",
      "Xi really doesn't need to do anything to help Donald Trump weaken the US (market) on the World Stage right now but we all appreciate the media machine trying to position it that way.",
      "Jesus fuck. \n\nWelp, better start learning Chinese.",
      "Xi is doing nothing. Its literally all being done by the US potus.",
      "Both men will have an easy job undoing US hegemony since our own President is doing that at record speed.",
      "That\u2019s what they say but it\u2019s more than likely to make it public that China has been feeding weapons and munitions to Russia for the Ukrainian war. A defense pact would also create the trifecta of NK, China, and Russia and greatly reinforce the authoritarianism in the world."
